WHAT TO DO


I set the convention that a string of the form $VAR will be interpreted by means of calling Character.__getattr__(VAR)/Character.VAR (the two will be equivalent)
Would this involve checking every string for starting with $? Surely there's a better way
It definitely comes up in bonuses; I can always check there
Also in resources


Variant: character file would have a map of {"name": "/path/to/source.file/path/to/value"} as I just wrote helpers.path_follower to address this
They would keep some parts locally (e.g. number on resources)
On levelup these would need to be updated somehow
